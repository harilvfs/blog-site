#### Hey! 👋 This is a chill little blog site made with React. Here’s how you can get it going.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install everything you need
bun install

# Start the dev server
bun start

# Make a production build
bun run build
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This site auto-deploys using GitHub Actions:

- Take a look at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Go to your repo’s Settings > Pages
- Pick "GitHub Actions" as the source
- Push to the `main` branch and it’ll deploy on its own

Your blog will show up at: `https://yourusername.github.io/blog-site`

## What’s Inside

- React + TypeScript
- Write posts using Markdown
- Looks good on phones and computers
- Super fast with Bun
